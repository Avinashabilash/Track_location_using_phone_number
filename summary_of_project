Track Location Using Phone Number

A Python application to track the location of a phone number and display it on an interactive map.

📜 Summary
This project demonstrates how to use Python libraries such as phonenumbers, opencage, and folium to:
Determine the location of a phone number.
Fetch the latitude and longitude of the location using the OpenCage API.
Display the location on an interactive map.
⚠️ Note: This app only fetches the general location based on the phone number's registered region. It does NOT provide live GPS tracking or violate privacy laws.

🚀 Features
Identify the location of a phone number (country/region).
Determine the carrier (service provider).
Visualize the location on a map using Folium.
Save the generated map as an HTML file for sharing or offline use.

Add the phone number you want to track in myphone.py:

python
Copy code
number = "+91xxxxxxxxxx"
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Check the output:

Location and carrier will be displayed in the terminal.
The generated map will be saved as mylocation.html.
Open the map in your browser:

bash
Copy code
start mylocation.html
